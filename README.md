# SALARIES-IT-INDIA
# Project Description:

The objective of this project is to analyze the salaries in the IT sector, in this case in India, and to give a clearer vision to workers with similar economies to India who are thinking of entering the IT sector.  Taking into account that India is an economy in constant growth and its average annual salary in India (2,150 dollars), we have an idea that it is not one of the most competitive salaries, a very similar situation is in Latin America, for example, Peru has an average annual salary of 6,460 dollars, Bolivia with 3,290 dollars, Ecuador with 5,960 dollars, just to give a few examples. 
So, given that the IT sector is in high demand and there is more and more interest, it is important to know how salaries move in one of the most important countries worldwide.
To do this, we will collect and analyze data from different sources to understand the trend of salaries in the sector, the types of positions most in demand, the cities with the best opportunities, and other factors that may affect the compensation of workers in the sector.

# Project Repository: 

The project repository will be divided into the following sections:

Data: This section will include the data used for the analysis. Information will be provided on the data sources, how the data were collected, and any processing or data cleaning that was performed.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this section, an exploratory analysis of the data will be presented to understand the distribution of salaries, skills in demand, and other relevant trends. Visualizations and graphs will be included to illustrate the findings.  An analysis was also performed using Power BI


Analysis Model: In this section, we will work with categorical and numerical variables, for which we will use KModes. We will work with the columns of Location, Size Company, Job and Salary. Then we will group them in 3 clusters


Results: In this section, the results of the analysis will be presented and their significance and relevance to the project objective will be explained.

Conclusions: In this section, the conclusions of the project will be presented and possible areas for improvement or future research will be discussed.
